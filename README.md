## ShopifyQL Entity Types

The query builder automatically determines the appropriate entity type based on your filters:

- **Products**: When using product-specific filters (type, vendor, tags)
- **Orders**: When using order-specific filters (status, financial status)
- **Customers**: When using customer-specific filters (email, country)

## Tips

1. **Date Format**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for dates (e.g., 2024-01-15)
2. **Tags**: Separate multiple tags with commas
3. **Validation**: The app validates number ranges to ensure min â‰¤ max
4. **Copy Queries**: Use Ctrl+C to copy generated queries to clipboard
5. **Clear Form**: Use Ctrl+R or the Clear All button to reset all fields
